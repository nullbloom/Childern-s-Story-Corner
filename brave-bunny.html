  <p>Once upon a time, in a peaceful meadow, there lived a little bunny named Benny. Benny was small and shy, and he was afraid of many things, especially the dark forest near his home.</p>

  <p>One day, Benny’s best friend, a wise old owl, told him about a magical carrot hidden deep in the forest that could make anyone brave. Benny decided to be courageous and find the carrot.</p>

  <p>As he hopped through the forest, Benny faced his fears. He met friendly animals who helped him along the way. When he finally found the glowing carrot, he took a big bite and felt a warm, brave feeling inside.</p>

  <p>From that day on, Benny wasn’t afraid anymore. He explored the meadow and forest with confidence, making new friends and living happily ever after.</p>

  <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
